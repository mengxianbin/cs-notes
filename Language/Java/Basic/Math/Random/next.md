    /**
     * Generates the next pseudorandom number. Subclasses should
     * override this, as this is used by all other methods.
     *
     * <p>The general contract of {@code next} is that it returns an
     * {@code int} value and if the argument {@code bits} is between
     * {@code 1} and {@code 32} (inclusive), then that many low-order
     * bits of the returned value will be (approximately) independently
     * chosen bit values, each of which is (approximately) equally
     * likely to be {@code 0} or {@code 1}. The method {@code next} is
     * implemented by class {@code Random} by atomically updating the seed to
     *  <pre>{@code (seed * 0x5DEECE66DL + 0xBL) & ((1L << 48) - 1)}</pre>
     * and returning
     *  <pre>{@code (int)(seed >>> (48 - bits))}.</pre>
     *
     * This is a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator, as
     * defined by D. H. Lehmer and described by Donald E. Knuth in
     * <i>The Art of Computer Programming,</i> Volume 3:
     * <i>Seminumerical Algorithms</i>, section 3.2.1.
     *
     * @param  bits random bits
     * @return the next pseudorandom value from this random number
