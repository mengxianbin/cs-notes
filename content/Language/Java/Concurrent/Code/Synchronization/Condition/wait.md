```java
    /**
     * Causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or
     * {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted}.
     *
     * <p>The lock associated with this {@code Condition} is atomically
     * released and the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
     * purposes and lies dormant until <em>one</em> of four things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@link #signal} method for this
     * {@code Condition} and the current thread happens to be chosen as the
     * thread to be awakened; or
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@link #signalAll} method for this
     * {@code Condition}; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts} the
     * current thread, and interruption of thread suspension is supported; or
     * <li>A &quot;<em>spurious wakeup</em>&quot; occurs.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>In all cases, before this method can return the current thread must
     * re-acquire the lock associated with this condition. When the
     * thread returns it is <em>guaranteed</em> to hold this lock.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
     * and interruption of thread suspension is supported,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared. It is not specified, in the first
     * case, whether or not the test for interruption occurs before the lock
     * is released.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Considerations</b>
     *
     * <p>The current thread is assumed to hold the lock associated with this
     * {@code Condition} when this method is called.
     * It is up to the implementation to determine if this is
     * the case and if not, how to respond. Typically, an exception will be
     * thrown (such as {@link IllegalMonitorStateException}) and the
     * implementation must document that fact.
     *
     * <p>An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal
     * method return in response to a signal. In that case the implementation
     * must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if
     * there is one.
     *
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
     *         (and interruption of thread suspension is supported)
